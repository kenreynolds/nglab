# Angular Lab

Generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.2.

This project serves as a front end development playground for me to experiment with various aspects of front end development and further cement my knowledge and skills in advanced Angular concepts and best practices.

[Angular Material](https://v15.material.angular.io/) is used in the project, and is added via a separate material module. You can add to that module as desired.

[NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) is used for UI state management.

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for quick, easy styling of various UI elements.


## Development server

Run `npm run dev:server` to start the json-server mock backend. Dummy data has been added to db.json, but you can change it to suit your needs.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
